We leverage big data for superior predictive accuracy, using state-of-the-art deep learning, reinforcement learning, and specialized foundation models. Our approach incorporates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), transformer-based time series models, and frameworks like Keras / TimesFM (Time Series Foundation Model) for implementation.
